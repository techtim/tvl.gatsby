Sun replacer for clubbers. Interacts with people on dancefloor, plays with them, answers to their moves and reacts on music.

Brings eye pleasure without heat.
Created for one of AUX events that me with my friends as do/nothing made at Arma17 Club.

Generative fluid texture that interactst with people moves covers the sphere. Created with custom openFrameworks app streaming Syphon to Modul8 + Kinect skeleton tracking for interactive texture generation.
